## My process

### Built with

- React library
- Styled Components
- Advance use of Flexbox & CSS Grid for styling
- React Router => Rendering of pages
- React Helmet => Dynamic search engine optimization
- Technical SEO library
- FormSpree API => Sends contact form messages
- Figma => Interprete & view designs
- Vercel => CI/CD

### What I learned

This is a project I worked on to practice react and react routing. It was fun to build because I had the opportunity to experience how to build reusable and scalable web components like a professional despite the challenging design. It was a good learning experience!
